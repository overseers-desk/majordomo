"""majordomo MCP server: the secondary front door (mirrors courier's shape).

Exposes the same reports as the CLI, over MCP, by going through the same reader
seam (`readers.make_reader`). The sieve is applied in the reader, so a tool
cannot bypass it. Each tool takes an optional `source` ("cache" | "live" | "nocache");
the default is the cache fast path with a direct-API fallback. Needs the `mcp` extra;
launched by `majordomo mcp` (stdio).
